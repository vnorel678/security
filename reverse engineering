## Static analysis
## We looked at c code
strings.exe -a -nobanner .\demo1_new.exe | findstr /i succ 
strings.exe -a -n 5 -nobanner .\demo1_new.exe | select -first 10 
strings.exe -a -nobanner .\demo1_new.exe | select -first 10 
strings.exe -a -n 7 -nobanner .\demo1_new.exe 

## Behavioral analysis

## Disassembly  
open gidrah > file > new project > non-shared > complete 
file > import file > navigate/select .exe > keep default options

## Patching
work from end, going backards
look for success or other messages
click on condition of statement you need for success to run 

look at the assembly > right click > path instructions
set cmp to the same "EAX,EAX" 

file export program > change format to a PE > change anme and location of PE
